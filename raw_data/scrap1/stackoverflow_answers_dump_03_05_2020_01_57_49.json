The method is then a variable arity method. Otherwise, it is a fixed arity method. Invocations of a variable arity method may contain more actual argument expressions than formal parameters. All the actual argument expressions that do not correspond to the formal parameters preceding the variable arity parameter will be evaluated and the results stored into an array that will be passed to the method invocation (§15.12.4.2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically, the last parameter of any method call can have <code>T...</code>.

You can actually force them to be same which will mean that at the end of the day you'll only need to punch one hole in the firewall (if firewall is your concern).</p>\n\n<p>Try setting System Properties:</p>\n\n<pre><code>com.sun.management.jmxremote.port\ncom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to the same value!!</p>\n\n<p>Explicitly setting these will stop RMI from picking random ports. Setting them to the same value will make sure it opens less ports to listen on.</p>\n\n<p>This will work in Java 7 update 25 or later.</p>\n\n<h2>What is the third port?</h2>\n\n<p>The third port that you see opened by your application (or the second if you followed my advice above) is used by the <em>Java Attach API</em>. It is what JConsole uses for connecting to \"Local Process\". The Java Attach API feature is enabled by default since Java 6 regardless of the <code>com.sun.management.jmxremote</code> property. This feature will use a random port (aka an OS ephemeral port) but it really doesn't matter because the feature only allows connections from the host itself. If you really dislike this feature then you can add <code>-XX:+DisableAttachMechanism</code> to the command line to disable the Java Attach API feature. Then you'll no longer see the java process (in this case Tomcat) listening on a random port.</p>\n\n<h2>How do I make JMX listen on the loopback interface only</h2>\n\n<p>With a custom made application you would use a <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/rmi/server/RMIServerSocketFactory.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">RMIServerSocketFactory</a> but this is Tomcat so you would have to do it using Tomcat's <a href=\"http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/listeners.html#JMX_Remote_Lifecycle_Listener_-_org.apache.catalina.mbeans.JmxRemoteLifecycleListener\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JMX Remote Lifecycle Listener</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand it doesn't matter now that you have the <code>com.sun.management.jmxremote.local.only</code> property since Java 7. It makes sure that only connections from the host itself are allowed. Mind you that JMX library doesn't achieve this by binding to loopback interface which would certainly be <em>one</em> way of doing it but also slight inaccurate as a host can potentially have several loopback interfaces.</p>\n\n<p>In fact by and large (with the most recent additions to JDK wrt JMX) I would say that Tomcat's <em>JMX Remote Lifecycle Listener</em> is now redundant except if you want to bind to some really odd network interface.</p>\n"

You'll typically need to turn the String into a byte array, and then feed that to the hash generator / digest generator.  For example, see @Bryan Kemp's answer.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you want a <strong>guaranteed unique</strong> hash code, you are out of luck.  Hashes and hash codes are non-unique.  </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A Java String of length N has <code>65536 ^ N</code> possible states, and requires an integer with <code>16 * N</code> bits to represent all possible values.  If you write a hash function that produces integer with a smaller range (e.g. less than <code>16 * N</code> bits), you will eventually find cases where more than one String hashes to the same integer; i.e. the hash codes cannot be unique.  This is called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pigeonhole Principle</a>, and there is a straight forward mathematical proof.  (You can't fight math and win!)</p>\n\n<p>But if \"probably unique\" with a very small chance of non-uniqueness is acceptable, then crypto hashes are a good answer.  The math will tell you how big (i.e. how many bits) the hash has to be to achieve a given (low enough) probability of non-uniqueness.</p>\n"

                "body": "<p>Put the word.txt directly as a child of the project root folder and a peer of src</p>\n\n<pre><code>Project_Root\n    src\n    word.txt\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I'd like to explain why this works for this particular case and why it may not work for others.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why it works:</strong></p>\n\n<p>When you use <code>File</code> or any of the other <code>FileXxx</code> variants, you are looking for a file on the file system relative to the <em>\"working directory\"</em>. The working directory, can be described as this:</p>\n\n<p>When you run from the command line </p>\n\n<p><strong><code>C:\\EclipseWorkspace\\ProjectRoot\\bin &gt; java com.mypackage.Hangman1</code></strong></p>\n\n<p>the working directory is <code>C:\\EclipseWorkspace\\ProjectRoot\\bin</code>. With your IDE (at least all the ones I've worked with), the working directory is the <code>ProjectRoot</code>. So when the file is in the <code>ProjectRoot</code>, then using just the file name as the relative path is valid, because it is at the root of the working directory.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, if this was your project structure <code>ProjectRoot\\src\\word.txt</code>, then the path <code>\"src/word.txt\"</code> would be valid.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why it May not Work</strong></p>\n\n<p>For one, the working directory could always change. For instance, running the code from the command line like in the example above, the working directory is the <code>bin</code>. So in this case it will fail, as there is not <code>bin\\word.txt</code></p>\n\n<p>Secondly, if you were to export this project into a jar, and the file was configured to be included in the jar, it would also fail, as the path will no longer be valid either.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, you need to determine if the file is to be an <a href=\"/questions/tagged/embedded-resource\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;embedded-resource&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">embedded-resource</a> (or just \"resource\" - terms which sometimes I'll use interchangeably). If so, then you will want to build the file into the classpath, and access it via an URL. First thing you would need to do (in this particular) case is make sure that the file get <em>built</em> into the classpath. With the file in the project root, you must configure the build to include the file. <em>But</em> if you put the file in the <code>src</code> or in some directory below, then the default build should put it into the class path. </p>\n\n<p>You can access classpath resource in a number of ways. You can make use of the <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html\"><code>Class</code></a> class, which has <code>getResourceXxx</code> method, from which you use to obtain classpath resources.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you changed your project structure to <code>ProjectRoot\\src\\resources\\word.txt</code>, you could use this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>InputStream is = Hangman1.class.getResourceAsStream(\"/resources/word.txt\");\nBufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getResourceAsStream%28java.lang.String%29\"><code>getResourceAsStream</code></a> returns an <code>InputStream</code>, but obtains an URL under the hood. Alternatively, you could get an <code>URL</code> if that's what you need. <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getResource%28java.lang.String%29\"><code>getResource()</code></a> will return an URL</p>\n\n<p>For Maven users, where the directory structure is like <code>src/main/resources</code>, the contents of the <code>resources</code> folder is put at the root of the classpath. So if you have a file in there, then you would only use <code>getResourceAsStream(\"/thefile.txt\")</code></p>\n"

This article illustrates, through a series of practical examples, the main traps of using Java's simple types double and float. Note, however, that to fully embrace precision in numerical calculations you a text book (or two) on the topic is required. Consequently, we can only scratch the surface of the topic. That being said, the knowledge conveyed here, should give you the fundamental knowledge required to spot or identify bugs in your code. It is knowledge I think any professional software developer should be aware of.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Decimal numbers are approximations</strong></p>\n\n<p>While all natural numbers between 0 - 255 can be precisely described using 8 bit, describing all real numbers between 0.0 - 255.0 requires an infinitely number of bits. Firstly, there exists infinitely many numbers to describe in that range (even in the range 0.0 - 0.1), and secondly, certain irrational numbers cannot be described numerically at all. For example e and π. In other words, the numbers 2 and 0.2 are vastly differently represented in the computer.</p>\n\n<p>Integers are represented by bits representing values 2n where n is the position of the bit. Thus the value 6 is represented as <code>23 * 0 + 22 * 1 + 21 * 1 + 20 * 0</code> corresponding to the bit sequence 0110. Decimals, on the other hand, are described by bits representing 2-n, that is the fractions <code>1/2, 1/4, 1/8,...</code> The number 0.75 corresponds to <code>2-1 * 1 + 2-2 * 1 + 2-3 * 0 + 2-4 * 0</code> yielding the bits sequence 1100 <code>(1/2 + 1/4)</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Equipped with this knowledge, we can formulate the following rule of thumb: Any decimal number is represented by an approximated value.</p>\n\n<p>Let us investigate the practical consequences of this by performing a series of trivial multiplications.</p>\n\n<pre><code>System.out.println( 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 );\n1.0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>1.0 is printed. While this is indeed correct, it may give us a false sense of security. Coincidentally, 0.2 is one of the few values Java is able to represent correctly. Let's challenge Java again with another trivial arithmetical problem, adding the number 0.1 ten times.</p>\n\n<pre><code>System.out.println( 0.1f + 0.1f + 0.1f + 0.1f + 0.1f + 0.1f + 0.1f + 0.1f + 0.1f + 0.1f );\nSystem.out.println( 0.1d + 0.1d + 0.1d + 0.1d + 0.1d + 0.1d + 0.1d + 0.1d + 0.1d + 0.1d );\n\n1.0000001\n0.9999999999999999\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>According to slides from Joseph D. Darcy's blog the sums of the two calculations are <code>0.100000001490116119384765625</code> and <code>0.1000000000000000055511151231...</code> respectively. These results are correct for a limited set of digits. float's have a precision of 8 leading digits, while double has 17 leading digits precision. Now, if the conceptual mismatch between the expected result 1.0 and the results printed on the screens were not enough to get your alarm bells going, then notice how the numbers from mr. Darcy's slides does not seem to correspond to the printed numbers! That's another trap. More on this further down.</p>\n\n<p>Having been made aware of mis-calculations in seemingly the simples possible scenarios, it is reasonable to contemplate on just how quickly the impression may kick in. Let us simplify the problem to adding only three numbers.</p>\n\n<pre><code>System.out.println( 0.3 == 0.1d + 0.1d + 0.1d );\nfalse\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Shockingly, the imprecision already kicks in at three additions!</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Doubles overflow</strong></p>\n\n<p>As with any other simple type in Java, a double is represented by a finite set of bits. Consequently, adding a value or multiplying a double can yield surprising results. Admitedly, numbers have to be pretty big in order to overflow, but it happens. Let's try multiplying and then dividing a big number. Mathematical intuition says that the result is the original number. In Java we may get a different result.</p>\n\n<pre><code>double big = 1.0e307 * 2000 / 2000;\nSystem.out.println( big == 1.0e307 );\nfalse\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem here is that big is first multiplied, overflowing, and then the overflowed number is divided. Worse, no exception or other kinds of warnings are raised to the programmer. Basically, this renders the expression x * y completely unreliable as no indication or guarantee is made in the general case for all double values represented by x, y.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Large and small are not friends!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Laurel and Hardy were often disagreeing about a lot of things. Similarly in computing, large and small are not friends. A consequence of using a fixed number of bits to represent numbers is that operating on really large and really small numbers in the same calculations will not work as expected. Let's try adding something small to something large.</p>\n\n<pre><code>System.out.println( 1234.0d + 1.0e-13d == 1234.0d );\ntrue\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The addition has no effect! This contradicts any (sane) mathematical intuition of addition, which says that given two numbers positive numbers d and f, then d + f > d.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Decimal numbers cannot be directly compared</strong></p>\n\n<p>What we have learned so far, is that we must throw away all intuition we have gained in math class and programming with integers. Use decimal numbers cautiously. For example, the statement <code>for(double d = 0.1; d != 0.3; d += 0.1)</code> is in effect a disguised never ending loop! The mistake is to compare decimal numbers directly with each other. You should adhere to the following guide lines.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid equality tests between two decimal numbers. Refrain from <code>if(a == b) {..}</code>, use <code>if(Math.abs(a-b) &lt; tolerance) {..}</code> where tolerance could be a constant defined as e.g. public static final double tolerance = 0.01\nConsider as an alternative to use the operators &lt;, > as they may more naturally describe what you want to express. For example, I prefer the form\n<code>for(double d = 0; d &lt;= 10.0; d+= 0.1)</code> over the more clumsy\n<code>for(double d = 0; Math.abs(10.0-d) &lt; tolerance; d+= 0.1)</code>\nBoth forms have their merits depending on the situation though: When unit testing, I prefer to express that <code>assertEquals(2.5, d, tolerance)</code> over saying <code>assertTrue(d &gt; 2.5)</code> not only does the first form read better, it is often the check you want to be doing (i.e. that d is not too large).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>WYSINWYG - What You See Is Not What You Get</strong></p>\n\n<p>WYSIWYG is an expression typically used in graphical user interface applications. It means, \"What You See Is What You Get\", and is used in computing to describe a system in which content displayed during editing appears very similar to the final output, which might be a printed document, a web page, etc. The phrase was originally a popular catch phrase originated by Flip Wilson's drag persona \"Geraldine\", who would often say \"What you see is what you get\" to excuse her quirky behavior (from wikipedia).</p>\n\n<p>Another serious trap programmers often fall into, is thinking that decimal numbers are WYSIWYG. It is imperative to realize, that when printing or writing a decimal number, it is not the approximated value that gets printed/written. Phrased differently, Java is doing a lot of approximations behind the scenes, and persistently tries to shield you from ever knowing it. There is just one problem. You need to know about these approximations, otherwise you may face all sorts of mysterious bugs in your code.</p>\n\n<p>With a bit of ingenuity, however, we can investigate what really goes on behind the scene. By now we know that the number 0.1 is represented with some approximation.</p>\n\n<pre><code>System.out.println( 0.1d );\n0.1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We know 0.1 is not 0.1, yet 0.1 is printed on the screen. Conclusion: Java is WYSINWYG!</p>\n\n<p>For the sake of variety, let's pick another innocent looking number, say 2.3. Like 0.1, 2.3 is an approximated value. Unsurprisingly when printing the number Java hides the approximation.</p>\n\n<pre><code>System.out.println( 2.3d );\n2.3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To investigate what the internal approximated value of 2.3 may be, we can compare the number to other numbers in a close range.</p>\n\n<pre><code>double d1 = 2.2999999999999996d;\ndouble d2 = 2.2999999999999997d;\nSystem.out.println( d1 + \" \" + (2.3d == d1) );\nSystem.out.println( d2 + \" \" + (2.3d == d2) );\n2.2999999999999994 false\n2.3 true\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So 2.2999999999999997 is just as much 2.3 as the value 2.3! Also notice that due to the approximation, the pivoting point is at ..99997 and not ..99995 where you ordinarily round round up in math. Another way to get to grips with the approximated value is to call upon the services of BigDecimal.</p>\n\n<pre><code>System.out.println( new BigDecimal(2.3d) );\n2.29999999999999982236431605997495353221893310546875\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, don't rest on your laurels thinking you can just jump ship and only use BigDecimal. BigDecimal has its own collection of traps documented here.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing is easy, and rarely anything comes for free. And \"naturally\", floats and doubles yield different results when printed/written.</p>\n\n<pre><code>System.out.println( Float.toString(0.1f) );\nSystem.out.println( Double.toString(0.1f) );\nSystem.out.println( Double.toString(0.1d) );\n0.1\n0.10000000149011612\n0.1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>According to the slides from Joseph D. Darcy's blog a float approximation has 24 significant bits while a double approximation has 53 significant bits. The morale is that In order to preserve values, you must read and write decimal numbers in the same format.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Division by 0</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many developers know from experience that dividing a number by zero yields abrupt termination of their applications. A similar behaviour is found is Java when operating on int's, but quite surprisingly, not when operating on double's. Any number, with the exception of zero, divided by zero yields respectively ∞ or -∞. Dividing zero with zero results in the special NaN, the Not a Number value.</p>\n\n<pre><code>System.out.println(22.0 / 0.0);\nSystem.out.println(-13.0 / 0.0);\nSystem.out.println(0.0 / 0.0);\nInfinity\n-Infinity\nNaN\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Dividing a positive number with a negative number yields a negative result, while dividing a negative number with a negative number yields a positive result. Since division by zero is possible, you'll get different result depending on whether you divide a number with 0.0 or -0.0. Yes, it's true! Java has a negative zero! Don't be fooled though, the two zero values are equal as shown below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>System.out.println(22.0 / 0.0);\nSystem.out.println(22.0 / -0.0);\nSystem.out.println(0.0 == -0.0);\nInfinity\n-Infinity\ntrue\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p><strong>Infinity is weird</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the world of mathematics, infinity was a concept I found hard to grasp. For example, I never acquired an intuition for when one infinity were infinitely larger than another. Surely Z > N, the set of all rational numbers is infinitely larger than the set of natural numbers, but that was about the limit of my intuition in this regard!</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, infinity in Java is about as unpredictable as infinity in the mathematical world. You can perform the usual suspects (+, -, *, / on an infinite value, but you cannot apply an infinity to an infinity.</p>\n\n<pre><code>double infinity = 1.0 / 0.0;\nSystem.out.println(infinity + 1);\nSystem.out.println(infinity / 1e300);\nSystem.out.println(infinity / infinity);\nSystem.out.println(infinity - infinity);\nInfinity\nInfinity\nNaN\nNaN\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The main problem here is that the NaN value is returned without any warnings. Hence, should you foolishly investigate whether a particular double is even or odd, you can really get into a hairy situation. Maybe a run-time exception would have been more appropriate?</p>\n\n<pre><code>double d = 2.0, d2 = d - 2.0;\nSystem.out.println(\"even: \" + (d % 2 == 0) + \" odd: \" + (d % 2 == 1));\nd = d / d2;\nSystem.out.println(\"even: \" + (d % 2 == 0) + \" odd: \" + (d % 2 == 1));\neven: true odd: false\neven: false odd: false\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Suddenly, your variable is neither odd nor even!\nNaN is even weirder than Infinity\nAn infinite value is different from the maximum value of a double and NaN is different again from the infinite value.</p>\n\n<pre><code>double nan = 0.0 / 0.0, infinity = 1.0 / 0.0;\nSystem.out.println( Double.MAX_VALUE != infinity );\nSystem.out.println( Double.MAX_VALUE != nan );\nSystem.out.println( infinity         != nan );\ntrue\ntrue\ntrue\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Generally, when a double have acquired the value NaN any operation on it results in a NaN.</p>\n\n<pre><code>System.out.println( nan + 1.0 );\nNaN\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Decimal numbers are approximations, not the value you assign. Any intuition gained in math-world no longer applies. Expect <code>a+b = a</code> and <code>a != a/3 + a/3 + a/3</code></li>\n<li>Avoid using the ==, compare against some tolerance or use the >= or &lt;= operators</li>\n<li>Java is WYSINWYG! Never believe the value you print/write is approximated value, hence always read/write decimal numbers in the same format.</li>\n<li>Be careful not to overflow your double, not to get your double into a state of ±Infinity or NaN. In either case, your calculations may be not turn out as you'd expect. You may find it a good idea to always check against those values before returning a value in your methods.</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n"

Some are even used in industry. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARK_%28programming_language%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Spark Ada</a> is probably the most prominent example. I've talked to a few people at Praxis Critical Systems Limited who used it for code running on Boings (for engine monitoring) and it seems quite nice. (Here is a great <a href=\"http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall01/G22.3033-007/spintro.ppt\" rel=\"noreferrer\">summary / description of the language</a>.) This language and accompanying proof system uses the second technique described below. It doesn't even support dynamic memory allocation!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>My impression and experience is that there are two techniques for writing correct software:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Technique 1: Write the software in a language you're comfortable with (C, C++ or Java for instance). Take a formal specification of such language, and prove your program correct.</p>\n\n<p>If your ambition is to be 100% correct (which is most often a requirement in automobile / aerospace industry) you'd be spending little time programming, and more time proving.</p></li>\n<li><p>Technique 2: Write the software in a slightly more awkward language (some subset of Ada or tweaked version of OCaml for instance) and write the correctness proof along the way. Here programming and proving goes hand in hand. Programming in Coq even equates them completely! (See the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Curry-Howard correspondence</a>)</p>\n\n<p>In these scenarios you'll always end up with a correct program. (A bug will be guaranteed to be rooted in the specification.) You'll be likely to spend more time on programming but on the other hand you're proving it correct along the way.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note that both approaches hinges on the fact you have a formal specification at hand (how else would you tell what is correct / incorrect behavior), and a formally defined semantics of the language (how else would you be able to tell what the actual behavior of your program is).</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few more examples of formal approaches. If it's \"real-world\" or not, depends on who you ask :-)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Coq Theorem Prover: <a href=\"http://www.labri.fr/perso/casteran/CoqArt/Tsinghua/C1.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Programming with Coq</a> (technique 2)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://secure.ucd.ie/products/opensource/ESCJava2/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ESC/Java</a> (technique 1, neither sound nor complete though)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/specsharp/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Spec#</a> (technique 1, neither sound nor complete though)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://krakatoa.lri.fr/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Why / Krakatoa</a> (technique 2, based on Java)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I know of only one \"provably correct\" <strong>web-application language</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.impredicative.com/ur/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">UR</a>. A Ur-program that \"goes through the compiler\" is guaranteed not to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Suffer from any kinds of code-injection attacks</li>\n<li>Return invalid HTML</li>\n<li>Contain dead intra-application links</li>\n<li>Have mismatches between HTML forms and the fields expected by their handlers</li>\n<li>Include client-side code that makes incorrect assumptions about the \"AJAX\"-style services that the remote web server provides</li>\n<li>Attempt invalid SQL queries</li>\n<li>Use improper marshaling or unmarshaling in communication with SQL databases or between browsers and web servers</li>\n</ul>\n"

                "body": "<p>In order to answer this question, you really need to define what you mean by \"provable\".  As Ricky pointed out, any language with a type system is a language with a built-in proof system which runs every time you compile your program.  These proof systems are almost always sadly impotent &mdash; answering questions like <code>String</code> vs <code>Int</code> and avoiding questions like \"is the list sorted?\" &mdash; but they are proof systems none-the-less.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the more sophisticated your proof goals, the harder it is to work with a system which can check your proofs.  This escalates pretty quickly into undecidability when you consider the sheer size of the class of problems which are undecidable on Turing Machines.  Sure, you can theoretically do basic things like proving the correctness of your sorting algorithm, but anything more than that is going to be treading on very thin ice.</p>\n\n<p>Even to prove something simple like the correctness of a sorting algorithm requires a comparatively sophisticated proof system.  (note: since we have already established that type systems are a proof system built into the language, I'm going to talk about things in terms of type theory, rather than waving my hands still more vigorously)  I'm fairly certain that a full correctness proof on list sorting would require some form of dependent types, otherwise you have no way of referencing relative values at the type level.  This immediately starts breaking into realms of type theory which have been shown to be undecidable.  So, while you may be able to prove correctness on your list sorting algorithm, the only way to do it would be to use a system which will also allow you to express proofs which it cannot verify.  Personally, I find this very disconcerting.</p>\n\n<p>There is also the ease-of-use aspect which I alluded to earlier.  The more sophisticated your type system, the less pleasant it is to use.  That's not a hard and fast rule, but I think it holds true for the most part.  And as with any formal system, you will often find that expressing the proof is more work (and more error prone) than creating the implementation in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>With all that out of the way, it's worth noting that Scala's type system (like Haskell's) is Turing Complete, which means that you can <em>theoretically</em> use it to prove any decidable property about your code, provided that you have written your code in such a way that it is amenable to such proofs.  Haskell is almost certainly a better language for this than Java (since type-level programming in Haskell is similar to Prolog, while type-level programming in Scala is more similar to SML).  I don't advise that you use Scala's or Haskell's type systems in this way (formal proofs of algorithmic correctness), but the option is theoretically available.</p>\n\n<p>Altogether, I think the reason you haven't seen formal systems in the \"real world\" stems from the fact that formal proof systems have yielded to the merciless tyranny of pragmatism.  As I mentioned, there's so much effort involved in crafting your correctness proofs that it's almost never worthwhile.  The industry decided a long time ago that it was easier to create ad hoc tests than it was to go through any sort of analytical formal reasoning process.</p>\n"

First, I would like to argue, use <code>Objects.hash()</code> or don't use the static Objects functions at all. Any argument for or against this method requires making assumptions about the compiled code that are not guaranteed to be true. (For example, the compiler optimizer may convert the function call into an inline call, thus bypassing the extra call stack and object allocation. Just like how loops that do nothing useful don't make it to the compiled version (unless you turn off the optimizer). You also have no guarantee that future Java versions won't include the JVM version like C# does in it's version of this method. (for security reasons I believe)) So the only safe argument you can make regarding using this function, is that it is generally safer to leave the details of a proper hash to this function than to try to implement your own naive version.</p>\n\n<h3>For Objects.hash</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Guaranteed to be a good hash.</li>\n<li>Takes 5 seconds to implement.</li>\n<li>Yours would have had a bug in it (somehow especially if you copy-pasted the implementation)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Against Objects.hash</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Java <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Objects.html#hashCode-java.lang.Object-\" rel=\"noreferrer\">docs</a> make no promises about hash cross-compatibility (Will a JVM v6 and JVM v8 give the same values? always? across OS?)</li>\n<li>The thing about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_hashCode()\" rel=\"noreferrer\">hashCodes</a>, They work best if \"evenly distributed\". So if an int value is only valid for range 1 to 100, you might want to \"redistribute\" its hash-codes to not all be part of the same bucket.</li>\n<li>If you have any requirement that makes you question how Objects.hash works, reliability/performance wise, Think carefully if the hash-code is really what you want, and implement a custom hash-coding method that addresses <strong>your</strong> needs.</li>\n</ul>\n"

Specifically, in Haskell, I could define a function like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>doublyNegate :: Negatable t =&gt; t -&gt; t\ndoublyNegate v = negate (negate v)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It is now known that the argument and return value of <code>doublyNegate</code> are both <code>t</code>.  But the Java equivalent:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public &lt;T extends Negatable&lt;T&gt;&gt; T doublyNegate (Negatable&lt;T&gt; v)\n{\n    return v.negate().negate();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>doesn't, because <code>Negatable&lt;T&gt;</code> could be implemented by another type:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class X implements Negatable&lt;SomeNegatableClass&gt; {\n    public SomeNegatableClass negate () { return new SomeNegatableClass(); }\n    public static void main (String[] args) { \n       new X().negate().negate();   // results in a SomeNegatableClass, not an X\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This isn't particularly serious for this application, but does cause trouble for other Haskell typeclasses, e.g. <code>Equatable</code>.  There is no way of implementing a Java <code>Equatable</code> typeclass without using an additional object and sending an instance of that object around wherever we send values that need comparing, (e.g: </p>\n\n<pre><code>public interface Equatable&lt;T&gt; {\n    boolean equal (T a, T b);\n}\npublic class MyClass\n{\n    String str;\n\n    public static class MyClassEquatable implements Equatable&lt;MyClass&gt; \n    { \n         public boolean equal (MyClass a, MyClass b) { \n             return a.str.equals(b.str);\n         } \n    }\n}\n...\npublic &lt;T&gt; methodThatNeedsToEquateThings (T a, T b, Equatable&lt;T&gt; eq)\n{\n    if (eq.equal (a, b)) { System.out.println (\"they're equal!\"); }\n}  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(In fact, this is exactly how Haskell implements type classes, but it hides the parameter passing from you so you don't need to figure out which implementation to send where)</p>\n\n<p>Trying to do this with just plain Java interfaces leads to some counterintuitive results:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public interface Equatable&lt;T extends Equatable&lt;T&gt;&gt;\n{\n    boolean equalTo (T other);\n}\npublic MyClass implements Equatable&lt;MyClass&gt;\n{\n    String str;\n    public boolean equalTo (MyClass other) \n    {\n        return str.equals(other.str);\n    }\n}\npublic Another implements Equatable&lt;MyClass&gt;\n{\n    public boolean equalTo (MyClass other)\n    {\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n\n....\nMyClass a = ....;\nAnother b = ....;\n\nif (b.equalTo(a))\n    assertTrue (a.equalTo(b));\n....\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You'd expect, due to the fact that <code>equalTo</code> really ought to be defined symmetrically, that if the <code>if</code> statement there compiles, the assertion would also compile, but it doesn't, because <code>MyClass</code> isn't equatable with <code>Another</code> even though the other way around is true.  But with a Haskell <code>Equatable</code> type class, we know that if <code>areEqual a b</code> works, then <code>areEqual b a</code> is also valid.  [1]</p>\n\n<p>Another limitation of interfaces versus type classes is that a type class can provide a means of creating a value which implements the type class without having an existing value (e.g. the <code>return</code> operator for <code>Monad</code>), whereas for an interface you must already have an object of the type in order to be able to invoke its methods.</p>\n\n<p>You ask whether there is a name for this limitation, but I'm not aware of one.  It's simply because type classes are actually different to object-oriented interfaces, despite their similarities, because they are implemented in this fundamentally different way: an object is a subtype of its interface, thus carries around a copy of the interface's methods directly without modifying their definition, while a type class is a separate list of functions each of which is customised by substituting type variables.  There is no subtype relationship between a type and a type class that has an instance for the type (a Haskell <code>Integer</code> isn't a subtype of <code>Comparable</code>, for example: there simply exists a <code>Comparable</code> instance that can be passed around whenever a function needs to be able to compare its parameters and those parameters happen to be Integers).</p>\n\n<p>[1]: The Haskell <code>==</code> operator is actually implemented using a type class, <code>Eq</code> ... I haven't used this because operator overloading in Haskell can be confusing to people not familiar with reading Haskell code.</p>\n"

                "body": "<p>Use NotAudited on fields when you don't want the value / relationship to be audited at all.  I believe you can use this on a field with or without a relationship such as OneToMany, ManyToMany, or just Column.   Use RelationTargetAuditMode.NOT_AUDITED on a relationship field if you want the value to be audited, but not the entity on the other side of the relationship.  For example you want the ID / key value audited, but not the related table.   </p>\n\n<p>You can also apply the RelationTargetAuditMode to the entire class, which I believe just says for all relationships in the class don't audit the other end.   This confused me as I was mistakenly using this annotation to mean don't audit the entity below, which is not what it means.  Just don't have an Audit annotation on an entity class at all if you don't want the entity audited.  On other audited entities that refer to the entity you'll have to either use NotAudited or RelationTargetAuditMode.NOT_AUDITED to the relationship field.</p>\n\n<p>The official documentation is not great about this topic (<a href=\"http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/4.2/devguide/en-US/html/ch15.html\">http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/4.2/devguide/en-US/html/ch15.html</a>) and doesn't even mention NotAudited at all.</p>\n\n<p>In my past projects I've had a need to audit a very specific set of tables and not others so I needed to use these annotations.  I have foreign key relationships to some of my non-audited entities from some audited entities.  I often use the RelationTargetAuditMode.NOT_AUDITED annotation so that at least I audit the foreign key value / ID, just not the entity on the other end of the relationship.   If you don't have this annotation you'll get a runtime exception where ENVERS tries to insert an audit record into an audit table for the non-audited entity and that table won't exist.  I use the NotAudited annotation for a few ManyToMany join table relationships that I just don't need to audit and there is nothing on the audited entity table itself to record (no foreign key ID / value).</p>\n\n<p>Oh yeah - the docs don't say what happens if you use both (not sure which one has priority), but I don't think using both simultaneously on a given field is intended.  Use one or the other.</p>\n"

Writing a separate class for the return type takes more time now, but it would convey more information to those that use your method (namely, it tells the users what the return value represents, and contains useful member names for the two values). If it is a non-public method that is used only a few places, though, a Pair is more acceptable.</p>\n"

Given no backend explicitly, Jersey will use <code>HttpUrlConnection</code> as a default backend.</p>\n\n<p>Jersey with HttpUrlConnection backend example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Client client = Client.create();\nWebResource webResource = client.resource(\"http://localhost:8080/path\");\nClientResponse response = webResource.accept(\"application/json\")\n                                     .get(ClientResponse.class);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Jersey with Apache Http Client backend example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>HttpClient apacheClient = HttpClientBuilder.create().build();\nClient client = new Client(new ApacheHttpClient4Handler(apacheClient,\n                                                        new BasicCookieStore(),\n                                                        true));\nWebResource webResource = client.resource(\"http://localhost:8080/path\");\nClientResponse response = webResource.accept(\"application/json\")\n                                     .get(ClientResponse.class);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Please note usage of Handler in the last example. This is a key integration abstraction for Jersey to incorporate and utilize various backends. First example uses <code>URLConnectionClientHandler</code> deep under the hood. </p>\n\n<p>Speaking about performance and features it makes little sense to compare Apache Http Client with Jersey. One may want to compare different Jersey backends here, as Jersey itself is merely a wrapping API. I'd like to highlight some key differencies between HttpUrlConnection and Apache Http Client based on my own experience:</p>\n\n<p><strong>HttpUrlConnection</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>No external dependencies are necessary. This may be quite valuable on embedded or mobile platforms.</li>\n<li>Extremely well documented everywhere</li>\n<li>Has poorly designed API. <code>HttpUrlConnection</code>-based implementation is difficult to maintain and extend.</li>\n<li>Many features are configured through JVM properties, some of which may be non-reconfigurable during runtime.</li>\n<li>In some cases hopeless at handling timeouts. You may end up setting 10 different JVM properties for different timeouts and still get your connections hanging forever in some circumstances.</li>\n<li>Since Gingerbread is a <a href=\"http://android-developers.blogspot.ru/2011/09/androids-http-clients.html\">recommended</a> http client API for Android.  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Apache Http Client</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For 3.X versions it's performance was somewhat similar to <code>HttpUrlConnection</code>. Version 4.1 contains lots of performance enchancements and performs way better than it's counterpart </li>\n<li>Quite good at managing connection and data read timeouts</li>\n<li>It's design follows <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle\">Open/Closed Principle</a>, so you can customize almost any part of HTTP processing with your own implementation. Examples: redirect strategies, retry strategies, custom cookie storages, interceptors for requests/responses, etc.</li>\n<li>Provides rich proxy support with customizable route builders for complex multy-proxy paths</li>\n<li>Has out of the box per-route connection pool. This may give a good performance benefit if SSL/TLS is used, especialy having hardware PKCS#11 tokens involved. <code>HttpUrlConnection</code> also has an internal pooling, but you have no tools to customize what or when to pool, no monitoring facilities to check the pool state.</li>\n<li>Features detailed logging</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Keep in mind, that it also possible to use other backends (e.g. for non-blocking clients) with Jersey if you have an appropriate <code>com.sun.jersey.api.client.ClientHandler</code> implementation.</p>\n"

                "body": "<blockquote>\n  <p>What's the difference between undefined in Haskell and null in Java?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ok, let's back up a little.</p>\n\n<p>\"undefined\" in Haskell is an example of a \"bottom\" value (denoted ⊥). Such a value represents any undefined, stuck or partial state in the program.</p>\n\n<p>Many different forms of bottom exist: non-terminating loops, exceptions, pattern match failures -- basically any state in the program that is undefined in some sense. The value <code>undefined :: a</code> is a canonical example of a value that puts the program in an undefined state.</p>\n\n<p><code>undefined</code> itself isn't particularly special -- its not wired in -- and you can implement Haskell's <code>undefined</code> using any bottom-yielding expression. E.g. this is a valid implementation of <code>undefined</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code> &gt; undefined = undefined\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or exiting immediately (the old Gofer compiler used this definition):</p>\n\n<pre><code> &gt; undefined | False = undefined\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The primary property of bottom is that if an expression evaluates to bottom, your entire program will evaluate to bottom: the program is in an undefined state.</p>\n\n<p>Why would you want such a value? Well, in a lazy language, you can often manipulate structures or functions that store bottom values, without the program being itself bottom.</p>\n\n<p>E.g. a list of infinite loops is perfectly cromulent:</p>\n\n<pre><code> &gt; let xs = [ let f = f in f \n            , let g n = g (n+1) in g 0\n            ]\n &gt; :t xs\n xs :: [t]\n &gt; length xs\n 2\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I just can't do much with the elements of the list:</p>\n\n<pre><code> &gt; head xs\n ^CInterrupted.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This manipulation of infinite stuff is part of why Haskell's so fun and expressive. A result of laziness is Haskell pays particularly close attention to <code>bottom</code> values.</p>\n\n<p>However, clearly, the concept of bottom applies equally well to Java, or any (non-total) language. In Java, there are many expressions that yield \"bottom\" values:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>comparing a reference against null (though note, not <code>null</code> itself, which is well-defined);</li>\n<li>division by zero;</li>\n<li>out-of-bounds exceptions;</li>\n<li>an infinite loop, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You just don't have the ability to substitute one bottom for another very easily, and the Java compiler doesn't do a lot to reason about bottom values. However, such values are there.</p>\n\n<p>In summary,</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>dereferencing a <code>null</code> value in Java is one specific expression that yields a bottom value in Java;</li>\n<li>the <code>undefined</code> value in Haskell is a generic bottom-yielding expression that can be used anywhere a bottom value is required in Haskell.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That's how they're similar.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Postscript</strong></p>\n\n<p>As to the question of <code>null</code> itself: why it is considered bad form?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly, Java's <code>null</code> is essentially equivalent to <strong>adding an implicit <code>Maybe a</code> to every type <code>a</code> in Haskell</strong>.</li>\n<li>Dereferencing <code>null</code> is equivalent to pattern matching for only the <code>Just</code> case: <code>f (Just a) = ... a ...</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So when the value passed in is <code>Nothing</code> (in Haskell), or <code>null</code> (in Java), your program reaches an undefined state. This is bad: your program crashes.</p>\n\n<p>So, by adding <code>null</code> to <em>every</em> type, you've just made it far easier to create <code>bottom</code> values by accident -- the types no longer help you. Your language is no longer helping you prevent that particular kind of error, and that's bad.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, other bottom values are still there: exceptions (like <code>undefined</code>) , or infinite loops. Adding a new possible failure mode to every function -- dereferencing <code>null</code> -- just makes it easier to write programs that crash.</p>\n"

another way of keeping your items in a single <code>ArrayList</code> of objects so that you can set an attribute tagging the items to indicate which item is from first list and which one belongs to second list. Then pass that <code>ArrayList</code> into your <code>RecyclerView</code> and then implement the logic inside adapter to populate them dynamically. </p>\n\n<p>Hope that helps. </p>\n"

                "body": "<p>I ran into similar problem a while back and what was happening in my case was the outer recycler view was working perfectly fine but the the adapter of inner/second recycler view had minor issues all the methods like constructor got initiated and even getCount() method was being called, although the final methods responsible to generate view ie..</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>1. onBindViewHolder() methods never got called. --> Problem 1.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>2. When it got called finally it never show the list items/rows of recycler view. --> Problem 2.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Reason why this happened</em></strong> :: When you put a recycler view inside another recycler view, then height of the first/outer recycler view is not auto adjusted.  It is defined when the first/outer view is created and then it remains fixed.  At that point your second/inner recycler view has not yet loaded its items and thus its height is set as zero and never changes even when it gets data. Then when onBindViewHolder() in your second/inner recycler view <em>is</em> called, it gets items but it doesn't have the space to show them because its height is still zero. So the items in the second recycler view are never shown even when the onBindViewHolder() has added them to it.</p>\n\n<p><em>Solution</em> :: you have to create your custom LinearLayoutManager for the second recycler view and that is it. \nTo create your own LinearLayoutManager:  <em>Create a Java class with the name <code>CustomLinearLayoutManager</code> and paste the code below into it. <strong>NO CHANGES REQUIRED</em></strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>public class CustomLinearLayoutManager extends LinearLayoutManager {\n\n    private static final String TAG = CustomLinearLayoutManager.class.getSimpleName();\n\n    public CustomLinearLayoutManager(Context context) {\n        super(context);\n\n    }\n\n    public CustomLinearLayoutManager(Context context, int orientation, boolean reverseLayout) {\n        super(context, orientation, reverseLayout);\n    }\n\n    private int[] mMeasuredDimension = new int[2];\n\n    @Override\n    public void onMeasure(RecyclerView.Recycler recycler, RecyclerView.State state, int widthSpec, int heightSpec) {\n\n        final int widthMode = View.MeasureSpec.getMode(widthSpec);\n        final int heightMode = View.MeasureSpec.getMode(heightSpec);\n        final int widthSize = View.MeasureSpec.getSize(widthSpec);\n        final int heightSize = View.MeasureSpec.getSize(heightSpec);\n\n        int width = 0;\n        int height = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; getItemCount(); i++) {\n            measureScrapChild(recycler, i, View.MeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpec(i, View.MeasureSpec.UNSPECIFIED),\n                    View.MeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpec(i, View.MeasureSpec.UNSPECIFIED),\n                    mMeasuredDimension);\n\n\n            if (getOrientation() == HORIZONTAL) {\n                width = width + mMeasuredDimension[0];\n                if (i == 0) {\n                    height = mMeasuredDimension[1];\n                }\n            } else {\n                height = height + mMeasuredDimension[1];\n                if (i == 0) {\n                    width = mMeasuredDimension[0];\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        switch (widthMode) {\n            case View.MeasureSpec.EXACTLY:\n                width = widthSize;\n            case View.MeasureSpec.AT_MOST:\n            case View.MeasureSpec.UNSPECIFIED:\n        }\n\n        switch (heightMode) {\n            case View.MeasureSpec.EXACTLY:\n                height = heightSize;\n            case View.MeasureSpec.AT_MOST:\n            case View.MeasureSpec.UNSPECIFIED:\n        }\n\n        setMeasuredDimension(width, height);\n    }\n\n    private void measureScrapChild(RecyclerView.Recycler recycler, int position, int widthSpec,\n                                   int heightSpec, int[] measuredDimension) {\n        try {\n            View view = recycler.getViewForPosition(position);\n\n            if (view != null) {\n                RecyclerView.LayoutParams p = (RecyclerView.LayoutParams) view.getLayoutParams();\n\n                int childWidthSpec = ViewGroup.getChildMeasureSpec(widthSpec,\n                        getPaddingLeft() + getPaddingRight(), p.width);\n\n                int childHeightSpec = ViewGroup.getChildMeasureSpec(heightSpec,\n                        getPaddingTop() + getPaddingBottom(), p.height);\n\n                view.measure(childWidthSpec, childHeightSpec);\n                measuredDimension[0] = view.getMeasuredWidth() + p.leftMargin + p.rightMargin;\n                measuredDimension[1] = view.getMeasuredHeight() + p.bottomMargin + p.topMargin;\n                recycler.recycleView(view);\n            }\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"

This method is thread-safe and typically called (automatically and implicitly) by the try-with-resources statement.</p>\n  \n  <p>The suppression behavior is enabled unless disabled via a constructor. When suppression is disabled, this method does nothing other than to validate its argument.</p>\n  \n  <p>Note that when one exception causes another exception, the first exception is usually caught and then the second exception is thrown in response. In other words, there is a causal connection between the two exceptions. In contrast, there are situations where two independent exceptions can be thrown in sibling code blocks, in particular in the try block of a try-with-resources statement and the compiler-generated finally block which closes the resource. In these situations, only one of the thrown exceptions can be propagated. In the try-with-resources statement, when there are two such exceptions, the exception originating from the try block is propagated and the exception from the finally block is added to the list of exceptions suppressed by the exception from the try block. As an exception unwinds the stack, it can accumulate multiple suppressed exceptions.</p>\n  \n  <p>An exception may have suppressed exceptions while also being caused by another exception. Whether or not an exception has a cause is semantically known at the time of its creation, unlike whether or not an exception will suppress other exceptions which is typically only determined after an exception is thrown.</p>\n  \n  <p>Note that programmer written code is also able to take advantage of calling this method in situations where there are multiple sibling exceptions and only one can be propagated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that last paragraph, which seems to suit your case.</p>\n"

The query is build using the JPA Criteria API link.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class TravelSpecification implements Specification&lt;Travel&gt; {\n\n    private final Travel criteria;\n\n    public TravelSpecification(Travel criteria) {\n        this.criteria=criteria;\n    }\n\n    public Predicate toPredicate(Root&lt;T&gt; root, CriteriaQuery&lt;?&gt; query, CriteriaBuilder builder) {\n        // create query/predicate here.\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And finally you need to modify your controller to use the new <code>findAll</code> method (I took the liberty to clean it up a little).</p>\n\n<pre><code>@RequestMapping(\"/search\")  \npublic String search(@ModelAttribute Travel search, Pageable pageable, Model model) {  \nSpecification&lt;Travel&gt; spec = new TravelSpecification(search);\n    Page&lt;Travel&gt; travels  = travelRep.findAll(spec, pageable);\n    model.addObject(\"page\", new PageWrapper(travels, \"/search\"));\n    return \"travels/list\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Using <code>QueryDslPredicateExecutor</code></h2>\n\n<p>First add the <code>QueryDslPredicateExecutor</code> to your <code>TravelRepository</code> this will give you a <code>findAll(Predicate)</code> method and you can remove your custom finder methods.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public interface TravelRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;Travel, Long&gt;, QueryDslPredicateExecutor&lt;Travel&gt; {}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Next you would implement a service method which would use the <code>Travel</code> object to build a predicate using QueryDSL.</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Service\n@Transactional\npublic class TravelService {\n\n    private final TravelRepository travels;\n\n    public TravelService(TravelRepository travels) {\n        this.travels=travels;\n    }\n\n    public Iterable&lt;Travel&gt; search(Travel criteria) {\n\n        BooleanExpression predicate = QTravel.travel...\n        return travels.findAll(predicate);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://spring.io/blog/2011/04/26/advanced-spring-data-jpa-specifications-and-querydsl/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this bog post</a>.</p>\n"

If you use Java 7, you will need to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9436219/compile-javafx-2-0-manually\">add it to your classpath and use appropriate JavaFX packaging tools</a> to allow your users to run your application.

This is different from ending with a blank line, a.k.a. empty newline.</p>\n\n<p><em>Edit: As @Easy Angel succinctly clarified in the comments: trailing newline = \"\\n\" and blank line = \"\\n\\n\"</em></p>\n\n<p>I think either:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>your lead is either mandating that every file ends with a newline character, but its being misinterpreted as mandating that every file end with a blank line (i.e. an empty line that ends in a newline), or else</p></li>\n<li><p>they are trying to ensure every file ends with a newline character by actually mandating every file end with a blank line (a.k.a. empty line that ends with a newline), thereby ensuring files ends with at least one newline (and possibly redundant additional newline - overkill?).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Unless the editor actually shows newline symbols, its not always clear in some editors that a file:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><em>DOES NOT END</em> a newline at all,</li>\n<li><em>ENDS</em> with a single trailing newline, or</li>\n<li><em>ENDS</em> with a blank newline, i.e. 2 trailing newlines</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strike>I think most modern source code editors insert a trailing newline.  However, when using older more general editors,</strike> I would always try to ensure my source code files (and text files in general) always ended with a trailing newline (which occasionally came out as a blank line/empty newline depending on the editor I was using) because:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>when using <code>cat</code> to display the file on the command line, if the file lacked a trailing newline, the next output (like the shell prompt or a visual delimiter a script may output between files) would end up appearing right after the last non-newline character rather than starting on a newline. In general, the trailing newline made files more user- and script- friendly.</p></li>\n<li><p>I believe some editors (I can't remember any specifics) would automatically insert a trailing newline if the text file lacked one.  This would make it appear like the file was modified.  It would get confusing if you have a bunch of files open in different windows and then go to close all of them - the editor prompts you to save but you are unsure whether you made \"real changes\" to the file or its just the auto-inserted newline.</p></li>\n<li><p>Some tools like <code>diff</code> and some compilers will complain about a missing trailing newline.  This is more noise that users and tools may have to deal with.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><em>Edit:</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>About editors adding newlines and not being able to see whether there's a newline vs blank newline at the end of the file, I just tested Vim, Eclipse, and Emacs (on my Windows system with Cygwin): I opened a new file, typed 'h' 'e' 'l' 'l' 'o' and saved without hitting [ENTER]. I examined each file with <code>od -c -t x1</code>.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Vim     <em>did</em>     add a trailing newline.</li>\n<li>Emacs   <em>did</em>     add a trailing newline.</li>\n<li>Eclipse <em>did NOT</em> add a trailing newline.  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>But </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Vim <em>did NOT</em> allow me to cursor down to a blank line under \"hello\".</li>\n<li>Emacs <em>did</em> allow me to cursor down to a blank line under \"hello\".</li>\n<li>Eclipse <em>did NOT</em> allow me to cursor down to a blank line under \"hello\".</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Interpret as you like.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>My personal practice is to try to ensure text files end with a trailing newline. I just feel there's the <strong><em>least surprise</em></strong> to people and tools with this is the case. I wouldn't treat source files any different from text files in this respect.</p>\n\n<p>Google turns up <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=trailing%20newline#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22No%20newline%20at%20end%20of%20file%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g4g-o1&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=ee5b8d49ec6ea034\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this</a>:</p>\n\n<p>which, as of this edit, show hits that talk about warnings about a missing trailing newline coming from C compilers, svn (because of diff), diff, etc.  I feel there's a general expectation that text files (source files included) end with a trailing newline and least surprising (and less noisy) when they tend to be there.</p>\n\n<p>Finally <a href=\"http://backreference.org/2010/05/23/sanitizing-files-with-no-trailing-newline/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this</a> is interesting:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><em>Sanitizing files with no trailing newline</em></strong><br>\n  Text files should have all their lines terminated by newline characters (ie, \\n). This is stated by POSIX, that says that a text file is</p>\n  \n  <p>A file that contains characters organized into zero or more lines.<br>\n  A line, in turn, is defined as<br>\n   * A sequence of zero or more non- characters plus a terminating  character.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>HOWEVER</strong>, all that said, this is just my personal practice. I'm happy to share my opinion to anyone that asks, but I don't foist this on anyone.  I don't feel this is something worth mandating, like I say <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4679314/is-it-bad-practice-to-call-super-in-a-class-that-doesnt-extend-anything/4679514#4679514\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While I'm one whose all for consistency, I'm also against micromanaging every bit of style. Having a huge list of coding conventions, particularly when some of them seem arbitrary, is part of what discourages people from following them. I think coding guidelines should be streamlined to the most valuable practices that improve the -ilities. How much is readability, maintainability, performance, etc improved by mandating this practice?</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

                "body": "<p>Short version: Yes you can.</p>\n\n<p>Long version:</p>\n\n<h1>How Java/JVM manages memory</h1>\n\n<p>For most applications the JVM defaults are okay. It looks like the JVM expects applications to run only a limited period of time. Therefore it does not seem to free memory on it's own.</p>\n\n<p>In order to help the JVM to decide how and when to perform garbage collection, the following parameters should be supplied:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>-Xms</code> Specifies the minimal heap size</li>\n<li><code>–Xmx</code> Specifies the maximal heap size</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For server applications add: <code>-server</code></p>\n\n<h1>That's not enough for me. I want more control!</h1>\n\n<p>In case the above mentioned parameters are not enough, you can influence the behavior of the JVM regarding garbage collection.</p>\n\n<p>First you can use <code>System.gc()</code> to tell the VM when you believe garbage collection would make sense. And second you can specify which of the garbage collectors the JVM should use:</p>\n\n<h1>Different Kinds of Garbage collectors:</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Serial GC</strong></p>\n\n<p>Command line parameter: <code>-XX:+UseSerialGC</code></p>\n\n<p>Stops your application and performs GC.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Parallel GC</strong></p>\n\n<p>Command line parameter: <code>-XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:ParallelGCThreads=value</code></p>\n\n<p>Runs <em>minor collections</em> in parallel with your application. Reduces time needed for <em>major collections</em>, but uses another thread.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Parallel Compacting GC</strong></p>\n\n<p>Command line parameter: <code>-XX:+UseParallelOldGC</code></p>\n\n<p>Runs <em>major collections</em> in parallel with your application. Uses more CPU resources, reduces memory usage.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>CMS GC</strong></p>\n\n<p>Command line parameter: <code>-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+UseParNewGC -XX:+CMSParallelRemarkEnabled -XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=value -XX:+UseCMSInitiatingOccupancyOnly</code></p>\n\n<p>Performs smaller collections, and more often than <em>Serial GC</em>, thus limiting the breaks/stops of the application.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>G1</strong></p>\n\n<p>Command line parameter: <code>-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseG1GC</code></p>\n\n<p>Experimental (at least in Java 1.6): Tries to make sure the application is never stopped for more than 1s.</p>\n\n<h1>Example</h1></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Memory usage of a Play Framework web application without any optimizations:\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/B9oPL.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/B9oPL.png\" alt=\"Play Framework WebApp without optimizations\"></a>\nAs you can see, it uses quite a lot of heap space, and the used space is regularly freed.</p>\n\n<p>In this case the optimizations with parameters only were not effective. There were some scheduled tasks which used rather a lot of memory. In this case the best performance was achieved by using the <code>CMS GC</code> combined with <code>System.gc()</code> after the memory intensive operations. As a result the memory usage of the WebApp was reduced from 1.8 GB to around 400-500 MB.</p>\n\n<p>You can see here another screenshot from the VisualVM which shows how memory is freed by the JVM and actually returned to the OS:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bLfiZ.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bLfiZ.png\" alt=\"Memory is being freed by the JVM and returned to the OS\"></a>\nNote: I used the \"Perform GC\"-button of the VisualVM to perform the GC rather than <code>System.gc()</code> in my code, as the scheduled tasks which consume the memory are only launched at specific times and somewhat harder to capture with VisualVM.</p>\n\n<h1>Further Reading</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cubrid.org/blog/dev-platform/how-to-tune-java-garbage-collection/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Article about tuning of the JVM GC</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/collectors.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Oracle Documentation of the available GCs</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

Its embarassingly easy to parallelize multiple game executions next to each other instead of parallelizing the sorting mechanism of one run which may only take a fraction of the whole game loop. You lost an easy way to parallelize now (e.g. when running the game in the context of genetic algorithms).</p>\n\n<p>But yes, if you happen to have large arrays and sorting is a substantial part of your applications runtime use <code>Arrays.parallelSort</code>.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:\nAnd even if <code>Arrays.parallelSort</code> switches to a normal sort if the given array has less than 4096 elements: it's all about showing intention - you want a parallel sort if possible which holds a different meaning than just calling <code>sort</code>. And to be nitpicky: it does indeed perform worse on small arrays as it has to do the additional check if the array is containing less than 4096 elements and some other checks about the common pools thread count (whichs overhead is of course negligible) :).</p>\n"

Actually, you should share them, as a single engine instance is a holder for a class cache and for JavaScript objects' hidden classes, so by having only one you cut down on repeated compilation.</p>\n\n<p>What you can't share is <code>Bindings</code> objects. The bindings object basically corresponds to the JavaScript runtime environment's <code>Global</code> object. The engine starts with a default bindings instance, but if you use it in multithreaded environment, you need to use <code>engine.createBindings()</code> to obtain a separate Bindings object for every thread -- its own global, and evaluate the compiled scripts into it. That way you'll set up isolated global scopes with the same code. (Of course, you can also pool them, or synchronize on 'em, just make sure there's never more than one thread working in one bindings instance). Once you evaluated the script into the bindings, you can subsequently efficiently invoke functions it defined with <code>((JSObject)bindings.get(fnName).call(this, args...)</code></p>\n\n<p>If you must share state across threads, then at least try to make it not mutable. If your objects are immutable, you might as well evaluate the script into single <code>Bindings</code> instance and then just use that across threads (invoking hopefully side-effect free functions). If it is mutable, you'll have to synchronize; either the whole bindings, or you can also use the <code>var syncFn = Java.synchronized(fn, lockObj)</code> Nashorn-specific JS API to obtain versions of JS functions that synchronize on a specific object.</p>\n\n<p>This presupposes that you share single bindings across threads. If you want to have multiple bindings share a subset of objects (e.g. by putting the same object into multiple bindings), again, you'll have to somehow deal with ensuring that access to shared objects is thread safe yourself.</p>\n\n<p>As for <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/script/ScriptEngineFactory.html#getParameter-java.lang.String-\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>THREADING</code> parameter returning null</a>: yeah, initially we planned on not making the engine threadsafe (saying that the language itself isn't threadsafe) so we chose the null value. We might need to re-evaluate that now, as in the meantime we did make it so that engine instances are threadsafe, just the global scope (bindings) isn't (and never will be, because of JavaScript language semantics.)</p>\n"

                "body": "<p><strong>Preventing Brute-Force Attacks:</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is a vast array of tools and strategies available to help you do this, and which to use depends entirely on your server implementation and requirements. </p>\n\n<p>Without using a firewall, IDS, or other network-control tools, you can't really stop a DDOS from, well, denying service to your application. You can, however, modify your application to make a brute-force attack significantly more difficult. </p>\n\n<p>The standard way to do this is by implementing a <strong>lockout</strong> or a <strong>progressive delay</strong>. A lockout prevents an IP from making a login request for X minutes if they fail to log in N times. A progressive delay adds a longer and longer delay to processing each bad login request.</p>\n\n<p>If you're using Tomcat's authentication system (i.e. you have a <code>&lt;login-constraint&gt;</code> element in your webapp configuration), you should use the <a href=\"https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/realm.html#LockOut_Realm_-_org.apache.catalina.realm.LockOutRealm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tomcat LockoutRealm</a>, which lets you easily put IP addresses on a lockout once they make a number of bad requests. </p>\n\n<p>If you are not using Tomcat's authentication system, then you would have to post more information about what you are using to get more specific information.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, you could simply increase the length of your API keys. 64 bits seems like an insurmountably huge keyspace to search, but its underweight by modern standards. A number of factors could contribute to making it far less secure than you expect:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A botnet (or other large network) could make tens of thousands of attempts per second, if you have no protections in place.</li>\n<li>Depending on how you're generating your keys and gathering entropy,\nyour <em>de facto</em> keyspace might be much smaller.</li>\n<li>As your number of valid keys increases, the number of keys that need\nto be attempted to find a valid one (at least in theory) drops\nsharply.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Upping the API key length to 128 (or 256, or 512) won't cost much, and you'll tremendously increase the search space (and thus, the difficulty) of any brute force attack. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Mitigating DDOS attacks:</strong></p>\n\n<p>To mitigate DDOS attacks, however, you need to do a bit more legwork. DDOS attacks are <strong>hard</strong> to defend against, and its especially hard if you don't control the network your server is on.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, there are a few server-side things you can do:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Installing and configuring a web-application firewall, like <a href=\"https://www.modsecurity.org/about.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">mod_security</a>, to reject incoming connections that violate rules that you define.</li>\n<li>Setting up an IDS system, like <a href=\"https://www.snort.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Snort</a>, to detect when a DDOS attack is occurring and take the first steps to mitigate it</li>\n<li>See <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/32761682/5019769\">@Martin Muller's post</a> for another excellent option, <a href=\"http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page\" rel=\"noreferrer\">fail2ban</a></li>\n<li>Creating your own Tomcat <code>Valve</code>, as described <a href=\"http://www.tomcatexpert.com/ask-the-experts/useragentvalve\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, to reject incoming requests by their <code>User-Agents</code> (or any other criterion) as a last line of defense. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the end, however, there is only so much you can do to stop a DDOS attack for free. A server has only so much memory, so many CPU cycles, and so much network bandwidth; with enough incoming connections, even the most efficient firewall won't keep you from going down. You'll be better able to weather DDOS attacks if you invest in a higher-bandwidth internet connection and more servers, or if you deploy your application on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/products/?nc2=h_ql_ny_livestream_blu\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Amazon Web Services</a>, or if you bought one of many consumer and enterprise DDOS mitigation products (<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/32767822/5019769\">@SDude has some excellent recommendations in his post</a>). None of those options are cheap, quick, or easy, but they're what's available. </p>\n\n<p>Bottom Line: </p>\n\n<p><strong>If you rely on your application code to mitigate a DDOS, you've already lost</strong></p>\n"

There may be some implementations that offer thread per connection, but I don't know, and it seems like it would be very wasteful.</p>\n\n<p>Creating a thread inside another thread doesn't establish any special relationship, and the whole point of doing so in most cases is to let the one thread do more work or terminate while the other thread continues working. In your scenario, using a different thread to do work required by a request will, as you expect, allow the response to be sent immediately. The thread used to serve that request will also be immediately available for another request, regardless of how long your other thread takes to complete. This is pretty much <em>the</em> way of doing asynchronous work in a thread-per-request servlet container.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> If you're in a full Java EE container, threads may be managed for you in a way that makes it a bad idea to spawn your own. In that case, you're better off asking the container for a thread, but the general principles are the same.</p>\n"

He explains reasons and motivations behind those principles, which I have elaborated on below:</p>\n\n<p>Classes that get reused together should be packaged together so that the package can be treated as a sort of complete product available for you. And those which are reused together should be separated away from the ones those are not reused with. For example, your Logging utility classes are not necessarily used together with your file io classes. So package all logging them separately. But logging classes could be related to one another. So create a sort of complete product for logging, say, for the want of better name commons-logging package it in a (re)usable jar and another separate complete product for io utilities, again for the want of better name, say commons-io.jar.\nIf you update say commons-io library to say support java nio, then you may not necessarily want to make any changes to the logging library. So separating them is better. </p>\n\n<p>Now, let's say you wanted your logging utility classes to support structured logging for say some sort of  log analysis by tools like splunk. Some clients of your logging utility may want to update to your newer version; some others may not. So when you release a new version, package all classes which are needed and reused together for migration. So some clients of your utility classes can safely delete your old commons-logging jar and move to commons-logging-new jar. Some other clients are still ok with older jar. However no clients are needed to have both these jars (new and old) just because you forced them to use some classes for older packaged jar.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid cyclic dependencies. a depend on b; b on c; c on d; but d depends on a. The scenario is obviously deterring as it will be very difficult to define layers or modules, etc and you cannot vary them independly relative to each other.</p>\n\n<p>Also, you could package your classes such that if a layer or module changes, other module or layers do not have to change necessarily. So, for example, if you decide to go from old MVC framework to a rest APIs upgrade, then only view and controller may need changes; your model does not.</p>\n"

However, at least on Linux, both methods can spuriously indicate that data is available when it is not, leading to <code>recv</code> blocking indefinitely.</p>\n\n<p>From poll(2) man page BUGS section:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>See the discussion of spurious readiness notifications under the BUGS section of select(2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From select(2) man page BUGS section:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Under Linux, select() may report a socket file descriptor as \"ready\n  for reading\", while nevertheless a subsequent read blocks.  This could\n  for example happen when data has arrived but upon examination has\n  wrong checksum  and  is  discarded. There may be other circumstances\n  in which a file descriptor is spuriously reported as ready.  Thus it\n  may be safer to use O_NONBLOCK on sockets that should not block.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Apache HTTP Client code is a bit hard to follow, but it <a href=\"http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org.apache.httpcomponents/httpclient/4.3.2/org/apache/http/impl/execchain/MainClientExec.java#256\">appears</a> that connection expiration is only set for HTTP keep-alive connections (which you've disabled) and is indefinite unless the server specifies otherwise.

When a connection is released back to the manager,\n  it can be kept alive however it is unable to monitor the status of the\n  socket and react to any I/O events. If the connection gets closed on\n  the server side, the client side connection is unable to detect the\n  change in the connection state (and react appropriately by closing the\n  socket on its end).</p>\n  \n  <p>HttpClient tries to mitigate the problem by testing whether the\n  connection is 'stale', that is no longer valid because it was closed\n  on the server side, prior to using the connection for executing an\n  HTTP request. The stale connection check is not 100% reliable and adds\n  10 to 30 ms overhead to each request execution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Apache HttpComponents crew recommends the implementation of a <strong><a href=\"https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.3.x/tutorial/html/connmgmt.html#d5e405\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Connection eviction policy</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The only feasible solution that does not involve a one thread per\n  socket model for idle connections is a dedicated monitor thread used\n  to evict connections that are considered expired due to a long period\n  of inactivity. The monitor thread can periodically call\n  ClientConnectionManager#closeExpiredConnections() method to close all\n  expired connections and evict closed connections from the pool. It can\n  also optionally call ClientConnectionManager#closeIdleConnections()\n  method to close all connections that have been idle over a given\n  period of time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Take a look at the sample code of the <strong>Connection eviction policy</strong> section and try to implement it in your application along with the Multithread request execution, I think the implementation of both mechanisms will prevent your undesired hangs.</p>\n"

I hope it's a good starting point!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:\n<a href=\"http://mindmeat.blogspot.com/2008/07/java-image-comparison.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here's someone with your problem who wrote his own comparison class in Java</a>. I didn't read the source code though. He expressly states that he couldn't find Java libraries for that purpose either, so that's why he wrote it himself.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and this <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/603283/what-is-the-best-java-image-processing-library-approach\">question on SO has probably the best links</a> on this, all regarding Java libraries of image processing. Hopefully there's one amongst them that can compare images for similarity.</p>\n\n<p>Ok, last edit:\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160305150423/http://www.lac.inpe.br/JIPCookbook/6050-howto-compareimages.jsp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Java Image Processing Cookbook</a> shows a Java implementation of a basic algorithm to determine the difference between two pictures. It also has an email to contact the guy who wrote it as well as a host of references. No library though.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT after reading your comment to your question:\nUnless you've already checked all of the above links, since what you want seems to be checking whether two images are equal, I would suggest starting with the Java Image Processing Cookbook (since that has an implementation of an algorithm in Java to check for equal images) and the last link to an SO question. Also, <a href=\"http://pdiff.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">check PerceptualImageDiff</a> and the source code of that project (C++); it sounds really nifty - it's apparently supposed to check whether two images look equal <i>to the human visual system</i>.</p>\n"

However, the <a href=\"http://download.oracle.com/javase/1,5.0/docs/guide/language/foreach.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">official documentation</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These shortcomings were known by the\n  designers, who made a conscious\n  decision to go with a clean, simple\n  construct that would cover the great\n  majority of cases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The great majority of cases is the answer for me.</p>\n\n<p>On a side note, personally, I think that <code>foreach</code> loop in Java is just a nice syntax for a standard iterator loop. So, the compiler creates the iterator for the structure and uses the variable to get the value for current iteration. To ensure that the variable has been initialised you need to declare it for the scope of loop (and I think this prevents the variable from being used somewhere else, e.g. in another thread). Because of that, you cannot use the variable after the loop. But, this is just my opinion and I would be very happy to hear from someone who knows it better. :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong> Here is <a href=\"http://today.java.net/article/2006/11/03/nuances-java-50-each-loop\" rel=\"noreferrer\">an interesting article</a> about <code>foreach</code> loops in Java. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Another edit</strong> I analysed (with <a href=\"http://www.ej-technologies.com/download/jclasslib/files.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">jclasslib</a> the bytecode of these methods:</p>\n\n<pre><code> private static void testForEach(ArrayList&lt;String&gt; als) {\n  for(String s: als)\n    System.out.println(s);\n }\n\n private static void testIterator(ArrayList&lt;String&gt; als) {\n  for(Iterator&lt;String&gt; is = als.iterator(); is.hasNext();) {\n   String s = is.next();\n   System.out.println(s);\n  } \n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Both methods are represented by the same bytecode:</p>\n\n<pre><code> 0 aload_0\n 1 invokevirtual #2 &lt;java/util/ArrayList.iterator&gt;\n 4 astore_1\n 5 aload_1\n 6 invokeinterface #3 &lt;java/util/Iterator.hasNext&gt; count 1\n11 ifeq 34 (+23)\n14 aload_1\n15 invokeinterface #4 &lt;java/util/Iterator.next&gt; count 1\n20 checkcast #5 &lt;java/lang/String&gt;\n23 astore_2\n24 getstatic #6 &lt;java/lang/System.out&gt;\n27 aload_2\n28 invokevirtual #7 &lt;java/io/PrintStream.println&gt;\n31 goto 5 (-26)\n34 return\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The difference is in line 1, the latter method uses <code>invokevirtual #8</code>. However, both invocations result in calling the same method of <code>Iterator</code>. So, it seems that <code>foreach</code> is nothing more than a syntactic sugar that the compiler just translates into a predefined construct, just as the documentation says. This does not answer the question <em>why it is the way it is</em>. I though this is just interesting and might be worth to know, in the context of the discussion.</p>\n"

They are created from a <code>javax.jms.Session</code>, so on that session disconnecting, either because of client disconnect or broker failure/failover, those queues are permanently gone. None of the other brokers will understand what is meant when one of your consumers attempts to reply to those queues; hence your exception. </p>\n\n<p>This requires an architectural shift in mindset assuming that you want to deal with failover and persist all your messages. Here is a general way that you could attack the problem:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Your reply-to headers should refer to a queue specific to the requestor process: e.g. <code>queue:response.&lt;client id&gt;</code>. The client id might be a standard name if you have a limited number of clients, or a UUID if you have a large number of these.</li>\n<li>The outbound message should set a correlation identifier (simply a sting that lets you associate a request with a response - requestors after all might make more than one request at the same time). This is set in the <code>JMSCorrelationID</code> header, and ought to be copied from the request to the response message.</li>\n<li>The requestor needs to set up a listener on that queue that will return the message body to the requesting thread based on that correllation id. There is some multithreading code that needs to be written for this, as you'll need to manually manage something like a map of correlation ids to originating threads (via Futures perhaps).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is a similar approach to that taken by <a href=\"http://camel.apache.org\">Apache Camel</a> for <a href=\"http://camel.apache.org/request-reply.html\">request-response over messaging</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One thing to be mindful of is that the queue will not go away when the client does, so you should set a time to live on the response message such that it gets deleted from the broker if it has not been consumed, otherwise you will get a backlog of unconsumed messages. You will also need to set up a <a href=\"http://activemq.apache.org/message-redelivery-and-dlq-handling.html\">dead letter queue strategy to automatically discard expired messages</a>.</p>\n"

There might be many other points, but I can point out as below.</p>\n\n<p><strong>JSON based approach :</strong>\nIf I am not wrong then this will be implemented using <code>Map</code> on server side.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Advantage :</strong> In JavaScript you can directly use  users.id1, users.id2 i.e. no need of iteration</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantage :</strong> On client side, some how you will require the ids present in your JSON i.e. either hard coding it or using some dynamic approach which will tell you which id is present in your JSON.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Array Based approach :</strong> If I am not wrong then this will be implemented using <code>Array</code>/<code>List</code> on server side.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Advantage:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>On client side, you can directly iterate through array, without\nworrying in advance about which id is present inside it i.e. no hard\ncoding.</li>\n<li>As pointed out by <strong>@JBNizet</strong>, array based approach will maintain the order.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantage :</strong> If you want to fetch single id then you will need to iterate through the array.</p>\n\n<p>Generally we don't send much information on client side, so array based approach will not create any problem. And <strong>transforming array into map is possible on both the side (server and client)</strong> if you want id based approach.</p>\n"

If you want to make a secret API, i.e. the existence of the API must itself be protected, that's not currently supported.
